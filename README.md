<h1>long story short</h1>

<strong>."Here I share myself with you. My home, my playground, my paradise."

In the bustling streets of Malé.
My journey began under the warm embrace of the Maldivian sun.
Born on June 29th, 1996, in North Malé.

Childhood was painted with hues of adventure and mischief, set against the backdrop of sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters.

From a young age, i reveled in the joys of island life, spending his days playing baseball and football on dusty fields, surfing colossal waves, and exploring the untamed beauty of the Maldives.

His nimble feet danced across the aerial roots of banyan trees, and he savored the sweet taste of young coconuts plucked from towering palms.

"Things change as we grow. they said, it would set me free. Instead, it confined me to a prison of expectations."

Despite his academic prowess, His ego swelled with each pat on the back and accolade.

Disillusioned by the praise, he yearned for something more, leading him to the bustling streets of the capital city Malé.

However, the promise of enlightenment soon soured as i found myself disillusioned by the bureaucratic tangle of the educational system.

Amidst the chaos, i stumbled upon a group of individuals who opened my eyes to a world shrouded in darkness.

Drawn into their fold, i embarked on a tumultuous journey that would shape my destiny.

At the tender age of eleven, my innocence collided with the harsh realities of life.

"They showed me a world shrouded in darkness. A world where rules were made to be broken, and boundaries were meant to be crossed."

As the years passed, my traversed the length and breadth of the Maldives, immersing myself in the vibrant tapestry of marine life and cultural heritage.

Yet, beneath the surface of paradise, a darker allure beckoned.

Retired from piracy and adorned with the ruggedness of manhood, my path took a treacherous turn.

Fueled by a thirst for power and recklessness born of heartbreak, i delved into a world of crime and vice, leaving a trail of chaos in his wake.

Haunted by regrets and weighed down by the burden of my actions, i found solace in solitude.

"I embraced the shadows, dancing on the edge of oblivion. But every step I took led me further from the light."

Alone with my thoughts, i navigated the complexities of my existence, oscillating between moments of introspection and bursts of unbridled rage.

In the confines of a prison cell, my resilience was tested, yet my spirit remained unbroken.

Surrounded by adversaries and allies alike, i forged bonds that transcended the boundaries of incarceration, emerging unscathed from the crucible of adversity.

"Alone with my thoughts, I searched for redemption amidst the echoes of my regrets."

Now, as i stands on the precipice of freedom once more, i carry with me the scars of my past and the wisdom of experience.

Though the road ahead may be fraught with uncertainty, one thing remains certain.

i am "force" !!

to be reckoned with, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

"I am a survivor. A testament to the resilience of the human spirit. And though the road ahead may be long and uncertain, I walk it with my head held high."</strong>
